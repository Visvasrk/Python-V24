# SandBox1 Directory

## Purpose
The **SandBox1** directory is specifically designed as a **controlled environment** to demonstrate the behavior of potentially destructive Python scripts. This setup ensures that the impact of such scripts remains isolated and does not affect critical system files or other directories.

## About the Script: `contagiousA0.py`
The `contagiousA0.py` script is a Python program with the following characteristics:
- **Destructive Nature**: The script is capable of overwriting or erasing Python files in the specified directory.
- **Demonstration Purposes**: It serves as an educational tool to showcase how malicious scripts can propagate, create backups, and modify files in a controlled and isolated environment.
- **File Infections**: By design, it targets Python files within the `SandBox1` directory or its subdirectories, such as `RealWorld1`.

### Features of `contagiousA0.py`:
- **Backup Creation**: The script creates backups before modifying files.
- **Custom Logging**: Maintains logs of all its operations, including successes and failures.
- **Overwrite Capability**: Rewrites Python files with preloaded or universal payloads.
- **Restoration Mechanism**: Incorporates fallback mechanisms to restore data from backups in case of errors.

## Important Information for Users
1. **Do Not Execute Without Understanding**: This script is destructive and should only be run in controlled environments like SandBox1.
2. **For Educational Use Only**: This setup is intended for ethical purposes to study and understand script behavior.
3. **Backup Your Data**: Ensure all critical files are backed up before using this script for any purpose.

# Please Excecute inside the SandBox1 only... 
- No members of this team is responsible for the irretrievable data loss if you execute the code outside the controlled SandBox1 environment.
- Note, this same file is present in the Original Directory also. **But without SandBoxes**.
- *That is only for analysis purpose and this directory is for live demo purpose*
