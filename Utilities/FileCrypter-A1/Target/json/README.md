*This folder deals with json file storing using python.*
***
Many of your programs will ask users to input certain kinds of information.
You might allow users to store preferences in a game or provide data for a visu-
alization. Whatever the focus of your program is, you’ll store the information
users provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. When users close
a program, you’ll almost always want to save the information they entered. A
simple way to do this involves storing your data using the json module.
The json module allows you to convert simple Python data structures
into JSON-formatted strings, and then load the data from that file the next
time the program runs. You can also use json to share data between differ-
ent Python programs. Even better, the JSON data format is not specific to
Python, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people
who work in many other programming languages. It’s a useful and portable
format, and it’s easy to learn.

```The JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation) format was originally developed for
JavaScript. However, it has since become a common format used by many languages,
including Python.```
